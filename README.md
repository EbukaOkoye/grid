# Description
This is a project aimed at replicatiting the gallery web pages of https://unsplash.com and https://pexels.com


HTML ans CSS were used in building this project. CSS grid layout was used as this is the easiest way to achieve a beautiful and responsive web page. A major challenge was in the responsiveness of the web page, fitting the web page into mobile screens and tablet screens. I used the display flex CSS property(my most prefered method of layout) to try to achieve this but it was not as responsive. This challenge was solved by turning the grid-template-columns into 1fr each for the smaller mobile screens.
